To find errors in my work, I try to make my analyses  reproducible, and rely on a few
best practices borrowed from the software industry, such as version control, code
review, testing, and sanity checks. Still, given that I do not always have co-authors who
have the time and ability to review my code, I am looking for other ways to
find and correct errors in my work.

Putting up an anonymous submission form only yielded one measly submission (although a
good one, which led to an erratum in Proceedings B, because it turned out the journal
published a later version than the one I quoted and commented on).

Stepping on people's toes with my work yielded more, but it's not a practice I want to
institutionalise.

## Bug bounties
So, I'm borrowing another practice from software^[The computer scientist [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check) has a similar program in place.]: a [bug bounty program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program). I'm slightly less well funded than Google and their ilk, but the Free Knowledge Fellow program by Wikimedia and the Stifterverband endowed me with some money to use for open science projects and this is how I choose to spend it.

So, what does this apply to, and what can you earn? 

### Criteria
- I'm first author.^[I don't want to scare people off of collaborating with me.]
- It's an empirical manuscript^[I know for a fact that there are bugs in my software, but it's open source and can be updated continuously, so just create an issue or send a pull request. Since I already don't earn money off it, I wouldn't want to penalise working on it even more.]
  - preprints count for the full amount (until they are accepted)
  - published papers count for 3/4 the amount
  - blog posts count for 1/4 the amount unless they are tagged `quick-job`^[For these, payouts are capped at one beer.]
- It was published after October 2, 2018.^[I am still grateful for error reports for older manuscripts, but I precommitted not to pay for them, so as not to inhibit responses via my Tell me I'm wrong form.]

The different factors for preprints, publications, and blogs reflect the amount of 
effort I already put in them and how easy it will me for me to correct something
at that point. So, because I would love to hear about errors before the publication
processes "enshrines" the paper^[I'm obviously not a fan of enshrining papers, but think we currently
lack a good mechanism of correcting papers citing an invalidated claim, so it's hard
to fix on our own.], errors in preprints are worth more than those in published paper.

### Budget
For now, I'm setting aside 2500€. When this runs out, I'll have to a) refine my
error checking workflow, b) get another stipend, award, donation, or tenured position, so
I can afford continuing to make errors. I'll keep this page updated, so should my
budget have run out, you won't waste too much time.

Within at most two months of the bug being reported, I'll pay out the sum via Paypal or bank transfer
or argue my case why it was not a bug. In severe cases, or if I'm ill, or out of work, it might take me longer, in these
cases I will post a note quoting the bug report and my intention to respond. In all
cases, I will post a note on this page, in more severe cases, I will start the process of
submitting a correction, an erratum, or a retraction. I cannot give a timeline on these
because of co-authors.

| Item             | Bounty |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Typos | A beer^[Capped at 3, I don't want you to get hungover.] if we meet. |
| Omitted citations | A beer^[Capped at 3, I don't want you to get hungover.] if we meet. |
| Error that changes a number reported in the supplement | 10€ |
| Error that changes a number reported in the manuscript | 50€ |
| A better way to statistically model or test something that leads to a different conclusion | 100€ |
| Coding error that changes a number reported in the manuscript, but not a conclusion based on the number | 100€ |
| Coding error that changes a conclusion in the manuscript | 200€ |
| Coding error that changes the main conclusion in the abstract | 500€ |

I will count the errors (by type, not by repetitions), not the numbers, or conclusions changed.

Please note that these bounties do not necessarily reflect only the gravity of a bug (i.e., missing a citation
can be pretty bad), but also my perception which of these are actually determinable objectively. So, by reducing
the sum for omitting citations, I hope to forestall drawn-out arguments by reducing both side's temptation to 
argue.

Any one person can claim at most 5 items, so up to 1100€. If multiple people notice an error, second reporters
only get a beer, and my heartfelt gratitude.

## Please help!
